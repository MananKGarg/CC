Introduction to Machine Learning (why, How, What)

ML is basically about not hard coding anything and let machine understand the logic and produce desired results.

    data + program ---> computer ---> output (traditional programming)
    data + output --->computer ---> program (Machine Learning)
   
So ML is about learning from past experiences (hope humans learn some of it too!) and improving the performance of intelligent programs.
