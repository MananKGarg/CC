Introduction to Machine Learning (why, How, What)

ML is basically about not hard coding anything and let machine understand the logic and produce desired results.

    data + program ---> computer ---> output (traditional programming)
    data + output --->computer ---> program (Machine Learning)
   
So ML is about learning from past experiences (hope humans learn some of it too!) and improving the performance of intelligent programs.


Types of ML 

1.  Supervised Learning - (Task Driven ---> Regression/Classification)
                          Input Data is called as training data. 
                          Training Data = Input + Labels (Targets or outputs)
                           
    So we feed the machine with lots of training data and predict the output with new data. This is                                 called supervises learning. (fast and accurate)
    
    Types - a) Regression - A continuous response value is predicted with respect to an output. For example, in value of stock,                             price is the value calculated at different times.
            b) Classification - Input is seperated into different 'classes'. Is the picture(input) a dog or a cat or a tiger?
          
2. Unsupervised Learning - Training Data does not include targets so we don't tell where to go. Also the data is not structured                            (noisy, unknown). example - random articles from different pages.
