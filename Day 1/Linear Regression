Linear Regression - Linear model to relate Target(dependant) variable y and one or more independent variables X(inputs).Goal is
                    find a best fit line to the data.
                    
                    y = m*x + b
                    
                    least square fit method gives us the m amd b for best fit lines
                    
Simple Linear Regression - Only one input x

Multiple LR - y = a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2....an*xn


Gradient Descent Algorithm

---> m and b are called weights in ML
